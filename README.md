# tm
TM is for the tradingview mesure program for crypto,
it use multi class objects that will be use with API of TradingView.

Write in Python 3 for Windows
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32

Dependencies : 
- python-tradingview-ta (install it with pip), more information at https://pypi.org/project/tradingview-ta/

cmd : pip install tradingview-ta

after, you can run the "tm.py" program like this, exemple with Vechain (VET) and Binance : 

in cmd : python tm.py VETUSDT CRYPTO BINANCE

that all !

You can of course write this in minus caracters but you must respect de numbers of arguments :

1 : the pair (btcusdt or btcbusd or vetbtc for exemple)
2 : type of you want to mesure, in our case "crypto"
3 : the trading plateform, in our exemple, Binance

I make a ExeFile in a ZipFile if you doesn't want to install python 3 or make complicated things.

Enjoy ;)
